    "Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm. It is widely used to search an element from the unordered list, i.e., the list in which items are not sorted. The worst-case time complexity of linear search is O(n).\n",

    "1. The user is prompted to enter a list of numbers.\n",
